\section{Introduction}

Quantum mechanics describes the behavior of matter and light at the atomic scale, where physical systems behave very differently from the ones in classical mechanics. A quantym system is characterized by:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item the \textit{state} of the system;
	\item the \textit{observables} (i.e., the possible outcomes of experiments), which allow us to probe the state of the system.

\end{enumerate}
