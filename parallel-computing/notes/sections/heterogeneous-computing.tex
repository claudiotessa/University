\section{Heterogeneous computing}

A \textbf{heterogeneous system} is a system that uses multiple types of cores to handle the complex variety of tasks found in real-world applications.

\subsection{Energy-efficient computing}

Given a fixed budget, the goal is not only to increase performance, but also \textbf{energy efficiency}. Specialization (i.e., hardware specifically designed for a fixed task) can generally provide better energy efficiency.

General-purpose processors are not energy efficient, as they always need to perform the same steps to address every operation (read instruction, decode, check for dependencies, etc.), while the actual circuit that would be required to perform that specific computation can could have been simple.

We can reduce energy consumption by using specialized processors, and trying to move less data. Minimizing the communication overhead increases performance, while also reducing energy consumption.
